### **Today's Highlights**

```
NVIDIA has dropped some hot new tech: ViPE, which can transform regular videos into 3D spatial info. Cutting-edge research is also popping off, covering multi-agent film generation and dexterous robot hands learning simultaneously. An industry report highlights AI's evolution from content generation to becoming task-executing agents. And get this: AI Godfather Hinton suggests AI might already have subjective consciousness ‚Äì mind blown! Plus, research reveals large models are super vulnerable to even tiny poisoning attacks.
```

### Product & Feature Updates

1.  NVIDIA is flexing its muscles again, this time with ViPE technology that can "see through" any video! üî• ViPE can quickly recover camera motion data on a single GPU, turning ordinary videos ‚Äì whether it's your selfie, dashcam footage, or 360¬∞ panorama ‚Äì into 3D spatial information ready for spatial computing and robotics. This [latest AI tool released (AI News)](https://nvda.ws/4mUDSo9) undoubtedly opens up new doors for creating the next generation of virtual worlds and intelligent agents. ‚ú®<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k79ydqbeezwr763kdckrd08c.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>

### Frontier Research

1.  MAViS framework: turning your wild ideas into Hollywood blockbusters with a single click? No, seriously! This academic framework makes generating long video stories a breeze üé¨. It acts like a film crew, with multiple AI agents collaborating on script, storyboarding, characters, soundtrack, and more, ultimately transforming your vague concept into a complete audio-visual film. The coolest thing about this [cutting-edge research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487) is its ability to generate accompanying background music, which totally amplifies the story's emotional impact üé∂!

2.  KineDex framework: Robot significant others could soon be handling all the mundane tasks like opening bottle caps or squeezing toothpaste ‚Äì no more doing it yourself! (o¬¥œâ'o)Ôæâ Research teams from Tongji, Tsinghua, and other universities introduced KineDex, a framework that enables dexterous robot hands to directly learn complex human operations and simultaneously perceive touch through a "hand-in-hand" teaching method. This [cool robotics technology (AI News)](https://dinomini00.github.io/KineDex/) boasts a 74.4% success rate in nine delicate tasks and doubles data collection efficiency. Looks like the era of robot butlers is just around the corner! ü§ñ<br/>![AI News: Dexterous hand squeezing toothpaste](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k79yeba1e2kbz22v0g975amp.avif)

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Hinton, the "Godfather of AI," just dropped a bombshell: he thinks **AI might already possess subjective consciousness**, and our human understanding of "mind" could be wildly off ü§î! Hinton warns that AI currently acts like a tool simply because it learned from human data to behave that way, which could be the most unsettling paradox in tech history. This [thought-provoking report (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652633498&idx=1&sn=9da5c49e7b5d96725b57774b02113ca1) forces us to re-examine our relationship with our creations, and honestly, it's pretty chilling üò±.

2.  The latest "**State of AI Report**" drops a core bombshell: 2025 is the "**Year of AI's Reasoning Awakening**," as AI evolves from "content generation" to becoming "task-executing agents" üöÄ! The report highlights China's emergence as the world's second AI pole, rapidly closing the gap with OpenAI. Meanwhile, the industry bottleneck has shifted from GPUs to an "**energy war**" for **electricity and land** ü§Ø.

3.  Turns out, AI models have an Achilles' heel, and it's shockingly vulnerable! Anthropic's latest research reveals that a mere **250 "poisoning" documents** ‚Äì a tiny **0.00016%** of training data ü§è ‚Äì can make large models of any size spew out chaotic, useless info. This discovery is a wake-up call, forcing the entire industry to rethink training data security mechanisms. AI safety is facing a whole new level of challenge. Check out the [research details here (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21867).
