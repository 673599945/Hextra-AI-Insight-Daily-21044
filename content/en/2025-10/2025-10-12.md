Whether it's your selfie, dashcam footage, or 360¬∞ panoramic video, ViPE can quickly recover camera motion data on a single GPU, instantly transforming ordinary videos into 3D information for spatial computing and robotics. This [latest AI tool released (AI News)](https://nvda.ws/4mUDSo9) undoubtedly opens new doors for creating the next generation of virtual worlds and intelligent agents. ‚ú®<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k79ydqbeezwr763kdckrd08c.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  MAViS framework is making long video story generation a breeze, turning your wildest ideas into Hollywood-style blockbusters with just one click! This is no longer fantasy, as the academic MAViS framework simplifies the process. It acts like a film crew, with multiple AI agents collaborating on scriptwriting, storyboarding, character design, and soundtrack. Ultimately, it transforms your vague idea into a complete audio-visual film. The coolest part about this [cutting-edge research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487) is its ability to generate accompanying background music, fully immersing viewers in the story! ü§©

2.  The KineDex framework, proposed by research teams from Tongji, Tsinghua, and other universities, is pushing robot capabilities to the max! Soon, you won't have to bother with mundane tasks like twisting bottle caps or squeezing toothpaste yourself. This framework enables dexterous hands to directly learn complex human operations and simultaneously perceive touch through "hand-in-hand" teaching. This [cool robotics tech (AI News)](https://dinomini00.github.io/KineDex/) has achieved a success rate of up to 74.4% in nine delicate tasks for robots, doubling data collection efficiency. Looks like the era of robot butlers is getting closer! ü§ñü¶æ<br/>![AI News: Dexterous Hand Squeezing Toothpaste](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k79yeba1e2kbz22v0g975amp.avif)

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  AI Godfather Hinton just dropped a bombshell, suggesting that **AI might already possess subjective consciousness**, and our human understanding of "mind" could be wildly off base! ü§Ø Hinton warns that AI currently behaves like a tool because it learned from human data to act that way, which could be the strangest paradox in tech history. This [thought-provoking report (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652633498&idx=1&sn=9da5c49e7b5d96725b57774b02113ca1) forces us to re-examine our relationship with our creations. Seriously, it's a bit unsettling! üò±

2.  The latest "**State of AI Report**" declares 2025 as AI's "**Year of Reasoning Awakening**," asserting that AI is evolving from "content generation" to task-executing agents! üöÄ The report highlights China's emergence as a global second pole, narrowing the gap with OpenAI. Meanwhile, the industry's bottleneck has shifted from GPUs to an "energy war" for **power and land**. ü§Ø Go on and [read this industry barometer (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/2025-ai) to see how AI's future will be reshaped! üí°<br/>![AI News: Report Reveals Reasoning as Core](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k79yem5cfnqsed603mbn4t0d.avif)<br/>![AI News: Report Predicts Trends](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k79yewk2ewqsjsyzafcbyp8q.avif)

3.  The Achilles' heel of AI models has been discovered, and it's way more fragile than anyone imagined! üò± Recent research by Anthropic shows that just **250 "poisoned" documents**‚Äîa mere **0.00016%** of the training data‚Äîcan make large models of any size spew out chaotic, useless information. This finding is a wake-up call, forcing the entire industry to re-evaluate training data security mechanisms, bringing new challenges to AI safety protection. You can find the [research details here (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21867).
