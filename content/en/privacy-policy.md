## Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data is the stuff that gets automatically collected when you're using the service.

Usage Data might include goodies like your device's Internet Protocol address (aka IP address), browser type, browser version, which pages of our service you've visited, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also collect info that your browser sends our way whenever you visit our service, or when you access the service via a mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies & Cookies
We totally use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our service and stash away certain info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts, all working to gather and track info, plus to supercharge and analyze our service. Here's a peek at the tech we might use:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file planted on your device. You can tell your browser to straight-up refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But heads up, if you don't say yes to Cookies, you might not be able to use some cool parts of our service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our service might just use them.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our service and our emails might contain these little electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These clever files let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other neat website stats (like checking out a section's popularity and giving our system and server integrity a thumbs-up).

Cookies can be 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even after you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser.

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**

  - **Administered by**: Us

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to follow our legal obligations (like, if we gotta keep your data to comply with applicable laws), iron out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also stash Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data typically gets kept for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security of our service or give its functionality a boost, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operational offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing hang out. This means your info might get shipped over to and kept on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the data protection laws might be different from yours.

By giving a thumbs up to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're totally agreeing to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is treated securely and aligns with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us to help you delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the service.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, modify, or delete your deets. You can also reach out to us to ask for access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

But hold up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll shoot you a notice before your Personal Data gets moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain scenarios, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data in good faith, believing such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the service
- Protect the personal safety of service users or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. 🤷‍♀️

## Children's Privacy
Our service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has dropped some Personal Data with us, please get in touch. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to scrub that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires a parent's thumbs-up, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. 🌐

We've got zero control over, and take no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before changes officially kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our service, and we'll update that 'Last Updated' date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy regularly to catch any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
