### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data ‚è≥
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent required to meet our legal obligations (like if we need to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is typically kept for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or we're legally obliged to keep this data for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data üåç
Your info, including Personal Data, gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This could mean your info might be zipped over to ‚Äî and maintained on ‚Äî computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might differ from your jurisdiction's.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy, followed by your submission of such info, shows you're cool with that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure your data is treated securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data üëã
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data, or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service. How convenient is that?

You can update, modify, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you have one) and heading over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal information. You can also get in touch with us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information you've given us.

But, hey, keep in mind we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data üì¢

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might be transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might cough up your Personal Data in good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Stay compliant with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
- Shield the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data üîí
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% bulletproof. While we hustle hard to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. Bummer, we know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Kids' Privacy üßí
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to scrub that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires consent from a parent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites üîó
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend checking out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just sayin'.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy üîÑ
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes become effective, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We recommend you give this Privacy Policy a periodic peek for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
