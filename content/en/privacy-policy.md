### Tracking Technologies & Cookies üç™

We leverage Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep an eye on activity within our Service and store certain information. These technologies ‚Äì think beacons, tags, and scripts ‚Äì are used to gather and track info, helping us to analyze and improve our Service. Here's a peek at what we use:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies):** A Cookie is just a small file tucked away on your device. You can tell your browser to say "nope!" to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. Heads up, though: if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've fiddled with your browser settings to reject 'em, our Service might just use Cookies.
- **Web Beacons:** Some sections of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These handy files let the Company, for example, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like gauging a section's popularity and verifying system and server integrity).

Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session." Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! üí®

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for a few good reasons:

  - **Purpose:** These Cookies are super important for providing you with the services available through the Website and enabling you to use some of its cool features.

### Retaining Your Personal Data

The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's truly needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (like, if we need to keep your data to obey applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

We also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Typically, Usage Data hangs around for a shorter period, unless it's used to boost the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally bound to keep it for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data

Your information, including Personal Data, gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. What this means is your info might be moved to ‚Äî and kept on ‚Äî computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might differ from yours.

By giving the green light to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're essentially agreeing to this transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure your data is treated securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including robust security for your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data

You totally have the right to delete your Personal Data that we've collected about you, or ask us for a hand in deleting it.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. From there, you can update, modify, or delete your information. Alternatively, feel free to contact us and ask to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to keep certain info if we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might be transferred. We'll definitely give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if legally required to do so, or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:

- Play by the legal rules.
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property.
- Prevent or investigate potential wrongdoing in connection with the Service.
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public.
- Guard against legal liability.

### The Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% bulletproof. While we go all out using commercially acceptable methods to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's a tough world out there! üõ°Ô∏è

## Children's Privacy

Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we discover that we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verification of parental consent, we'll take steps to remove that info from our servers.

If we ever need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parent's approval before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service might be sprinkled with links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry! üöß

We simply have no control over ‚Äî and assume no responsibility for ‚Äî the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before changes officially kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page.
