### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to comply with our legal obligations (like if we have to keep your data to obey applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get transferred to and kept on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might be different from your jurisdiction's laws.

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're essentially agreeing to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always update, tweak, or delete your info by logging into your account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also hit us up to request access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've tossed our way.

But hey, just a heads-up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

- Comply with a legal obligation

- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we try our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security. 🤷‍♀️

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has handed over Personal Data to us, please get in touch. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers, pronto.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parents' permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got zero control over, and take no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Sorry, not sorry! 😉

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.
