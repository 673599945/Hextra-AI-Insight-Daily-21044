*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy lays out our policies and procedures concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our Service. It also spills the beans on your privacy rights and how the law has your back.

We use your personal data to power and level up our Service. By using our Service, you're essentially giving us the green light to collect and use your info in line with this Privacy Policy.

## Getting Down to Basics: Explanations & Definitions

### The Lowdown
Words with initial capital letters have meanings defined under the following conditions. Whether they pop up in singular or plural form, these definitions rock the same meaning.

### What's What
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means a unique account crafted just for you to access our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party. And just to be clear, "control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other securities that grant voting rights for the election of directors or other managing authority.

- **Company** (referred to as "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) is all about **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies** are tiny files websites stash on your computer, mobile device, or any other gadget. They're packed with details like your browsing history on that site, serving up a bunch of purposes.

- **Country** refers to: California, USA.

- **Device** means any gadget that can hop onto the Service, like a computer, phone, or digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is any info relating to an identified or identifiable individual.

- **Service** refers to this Website.

- **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person processing data on behalf of the Company. Think of it as third-party companies or individuals hired by the Company to lend a hand in delivering the Service, performing services related to it, or helping the Company gauge Service usage.

- **Usage Data** refers to automatically collected data, churned out either by using the Service or by the Service infrastructure itself (like, for example, how long you linger on a page).

- **Website** is **hubtoday**, which you can find at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means the individual hopping on or using the Service, or the company or other legal entity that individual is representing when accessing or using the Service.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### The Kinds of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might hit you up for certain personally identifiable information that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data automatically gets scooped up when you use the Service.

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (like your IP address, for example), browser type, browser version, the pages you check out on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how much time you spend chilling on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you're hitting up the Service via a mobile device, we might automatically gather some intel, including but not limited to your mobile device type, your unique mobile device ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also scoop up info your browser sends our way when you're chilling on our Service or accessing it with a mobile device.

### Tracking Tech and Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. The tracking tech we're talking about includes Beacons, Tags, and Scripts. These are all about collecting and tracking info, plus supercharging and analyzing our Service. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file that gets plonked on your Device. You can tell your browser to ditch all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But here's the kicker: if you don't play ball with Cookies, you might miss out on some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject 'em, our Service might just keep on using Cookies.
- **Web Beacons**: Parts of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files, known as web beacons (also called clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs). These bad boys let the Company, for example, tally up users who've visited those pages or opened emails, and they're also used for other juicy website stats (like tracking how popular a section is and double-checking system and server integrity).

Cookies can either be "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser.

We pull out both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely key for dishing out the services available via the Website and letting you tap into some of its features. They're a big help in verifying user identity and shutting down fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you're asking for simply can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to give you those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to figure out if users have given the thumbs-up to using Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're hanging out on the Website, like recalling your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to serve up a more personalized experience, saving you the hassle of having to re-enter your preferences every single time you swing by the Website.

For more juicy details on the Cookies we use and your choices about 'em, hit up our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for the following purposes:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
- **To manage your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you tap into different features available to you as a registered user.

- **To contact you**: We'll hit you up via email, phone calls, SMS, or other similar electronic communication forms (like push notifications from a mobile app) to clue you in on updates or informational messages related to features, products, or contracted services – including security updates – when it's necessary or makes sense.
- **To provide you with news**, sweet special offers, and general intel about other goods, services, and events we're dishing out. This info will be similar to stuff you've already bought or inquired about, unless you've opted out of getting such messages.
- **To manage your requests**: This means handling and sorting out any requests you throw our way.
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to suss out or pull off a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, where the Personal Data we hold about our Service users is among the assets getting transferred.
- **For other purposes**: We might use your info for other stuff, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and generally checking out and boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share your personal information in these scenarios:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with Service Providers to keep tabs on and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: We might share or transfer your personal info during or in the run-up to negotiations for any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a chunk of our biz by another company.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates. If we do, we'll totally expect those Affiliates to play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies we control or that are under common control with us.
- **With Business Partners**: We might share your info with our Business Partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or promos.
- **With Other Users**: When you're sharing personal info or interacting with other users in public areas, that info might be seen by everyone and could even be publicly broadcasted outside the Service.
- **With Your Consent**: If you give us the green light, we might spill your personal info for any other reason.

### Hanging onto Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to follow our legal obligations (like, for example, if we gotta hold onto your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disagreements, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security of our Service or boost its functionality, or if we're legally obliged to keep it for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get shipped over to and stored on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might be a whole different ballgame than those in your jurisdiction.

By giving your nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're totally signing off on that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are some seriously good controls in place (including solid security for your data and other personal info).

### Wiping Out Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or to ask us to lend a hand in wiping it out.

Our Service might let you nuke certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can always log into your Account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, tweak, or ditch your info. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Data you've handed over to us.

But heads up: we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to do so.

### Spilling Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets into a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get shuffled around. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and falls under a different privacy policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might get tapped to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to a valid request from public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Stuff
The Company might spill your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to:
- Play by legal obligations
- Shield and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or dig into possible bad behavior connected to the Service
- Keep the personal safety of Service users or the public safe and sound
- Ward off legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is a bulletproof 100% safe. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't pinky swear its absolute security.

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't intentionally scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're clued in that your kid has dished out Personal Data to us, please hit us up. If we find out we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we gotta lean on consent as the legal hook for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just have to ask for your parents' say-so before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Sites
Our Service might have links that lead to other websites we don't operate. If you click a third-party link, you'll get rerouted straight to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you scope out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit.

We've got zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we're not taking any responsibility for 'em.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by dropping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll totally let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update that "Last Updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We suggest you regularly check out this Privacy Policy to stay in the loop about any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page.
