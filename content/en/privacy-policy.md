Usage Data is automatically collected when you use the Service.

Usage Data might include your Device's Internet Protocol address (like an IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you hit up on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
Cookies and similar tracking technologies are what we use to keep an eye on activity on our Service and store certain info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts. They're all about collecting and tracking information, plus improving and analyzing our Service. Here's a peek at the tech we might use:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: These are tiny files plopped onto your Device. You can tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't play nice with Cookies, you might not be able to use some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to say "no" to Cookies, our Service might just use 'em.
- **Web Beacons**: These are tiny electronic files (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that some sections of our Service and our emails might contain. These little guys let the Company count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like checking out how popular a certain section is and verifying system and server integrity).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the purposes outlined below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These are critical for giving you services available through the Website and enabling some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and stop any dodgy use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you’ve asked for can’t be provided, and we only use these Cookies to hook you up with those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to check if users have said "yes" to the use of cookies on the Website.

The whole point of these is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you use the Website.

For more information about the Cookies we use and your options regarding Cookies, hit up our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### Use of Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for the following reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, including keeping tabs on how our Service is used.
- **To manage your Account**: This means handling your registration as a user of the Service. The Personal Data you provide lets you access different features available to registered users.
- **To fulfill a contract**: This involves developing, complying with, and carrying out the purchase contract for products, items, or services you’ve bought, or any other contract with us through the Service.
- **To contact you**: We might get in touch via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic communication (like mobile app push notifications) to give you updates or informative comms about features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, when these are necessary or reasonable.
- **To provide you with news**, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we offer that are similar to those you've already bought or inquired about, unless you've opted out of receiving such info.
- **To manage your requests**: This is about handling and managing your requests to us.
- **For business transfers**: We might use your information to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Data held by us about our Service users is among the assets transferred.
- **For other purposes**: We might use your information for other reasons, like data analysis, identifying usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and to evaluate and improve our Service, products, marketing, and your experience.

We might share your personal information in these situations:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service, and to get in touch with you.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes mentioned in this Privacy Policy. We’ll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to comply with our legal obligations (like if we have to keep your data to follow applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually has a shorter shelf life, unless it's used to boost the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obliged to keep it longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This basically means this info might get moved to — and kept on — computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws could be different from yours.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy and your submission of such information is your green light to that transfer.

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete or ask us to help delete the Personal Data we’ve gathered about you.

Our Service might give you the ability to scrub certain info about you right from within the Service itself.

You can update, amend, or delete your information anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also hit us up to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information you've given us.

Please keep in mind, though, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We’ll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company may be required to disclose your Personal Data if it's demanded by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company may disclose your Personal Data, genuinely believing that such action is necessary to:

- Comply with a legal obligation.
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company.
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public.
- Protect against legal liability.

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we do our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service doesn't target anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your child has slipped us Personal Data, please get in touch. If we figure out we’ve scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to remove that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires a parent's consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get redirected to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
