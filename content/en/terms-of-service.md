# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll just call "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive in and start using our awesome services, please take a moment to really read through these Terms of Service. By simply visiting or using the Site, you're basically saying you agree to and accept these terms. Cool?

## 1. What We're All About (Service Overview)
So, what does **the Site** offer? We hook our users up with some sweet paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even some cool community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this awesome content is only accessible to our subscribed users. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get started, **users** need to give us a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all the activity happening on it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else – that's a big no-no!
*   If **users** ever break these terms, **the Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Our **subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** go through awesome third-party payment platforms (think Stripe, PayPal, etc.). Don't worry, **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment info – it's all handled securely externally. 🔒
*   Your **subscription** will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! You'll need to cancel it before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want to continue.
*   Alright, let's talk about **our 14-day refund policy**! If you're a first-time subscriber and you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Heads-up: this refund offer is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. Fair enough? 🤔

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** on the Site (that's `hubtoday`!) is copyrighted by us. No copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission – that's a big no-no!
*   **Users** only get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access right to the content, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, alright?
*   If you're thinking about **commercial use** or quoting a bunch of our stuff, please reach out to **the Site** to get authorization first. Let's talk! 🤝

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Absolutely no uploading, posting, or spreading** any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things positive and respectful here! ✨
*   **Bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking** member content using technical means is also **strictly prohibited**. Seriously, don't even try it.
*   **The Site** has the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban users who violate these rules**. Consider this your fair warning! 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up beforehand. Just so you know!
*   If **content** becomes temporarily inaccessible due to things like force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, **the Site** won't be held liable for any compensation. Bummer, but that's how it goes sometimes! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The info provided by the Site** is purely for reference. It's **not** meant to be professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Please don't take it as such!
*   **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might face from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Legal eagle stuff! 🦅
*   If **any dispute** comes up because of or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and sort it out amicably through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit the dispute to the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🙏
