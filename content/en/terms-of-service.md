# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (let's call it "the Site" or "we"). Before you jump in and use our services, take a moment to read these Terms of Service. If you access or use the Site, it means you're cool with and accept these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
Okay, so **what are our services all about**? We're here to hook you up with paid subscription content and exclusive member services. Think blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even some cool community interaction. Just a heads-up, some of that sweet content is only for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get an account, **you'll need to provide** a valid email address and set a password.
*   **Your account** is your baby! You're fully responsible for its security and everything that happens with it. And seriously, **don't even think about** transferring or sharing it.
*   **We** reserve the right to pump the brakes or even terminate your account if you don't play by these rules.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Our subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal), so don't worry, **we never store** your payment deets ourselves.
*   **Your subscription will automatically renew**, unless you decide to cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: If you're a first-timer and you're not vibing with our service within 14 days of buying it, you can totally ask for a full refund! Just hit us up at the contact email at the bottom of these terms and let us know why you're bouncing. Heads up, though: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, all payments are final and **non-refundable**, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   **All the original content** you find here is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. So, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so, okay?
*   **You** just get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content for your personal learning and reading pleasure. No sharing allowed!
*   **If you're thinking of using our stuff for commercial purposes** or quoting a lot, please hit us up first to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Absolutely no uploading, posting, or spreading** any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or messes with anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it.
*   **Don't even think about** using technical tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member-exclusive content.
*   **We** can remove any inappropriate content and will **ban** users who don't follow the rules. Just sayin'.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how it rolls sometimes.
*   **We're not on the hook for any compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Life happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The info we dish out on this site** is purely for reference. It's **not** professional advice (think financial, legal, medical, etc.), so don't treat it as such, okay?
*   **We're definitely not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are all about U.S. California law, and that's how we'll interpret 'em, no messy conflict of law principles involved.
*   **Any disputes popping up from or related to these terms**? Let's try to chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you agree to take things to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Deal?
