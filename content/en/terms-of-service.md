Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "Our Site" or "We"). Before you dive in, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By using or accessing Our Site, you're totally agreeing to these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
Our Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This sweet deal includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interaction. Heads up, some content is only available for our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
- Our Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis. You'll see the exact fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, Our Site doesn't store your payment info.
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** applies to first-time subscribers. If you're not stoked with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can request a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one refund shot. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by Our Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! You can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization.
- Users only get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** for personal learning and reading.
- For commercial use or extensive quoting, please contact Our Site to snag authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's strictly forbidden to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
- Also forbidden: using technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content. Seriously, don't even try it!
- Our Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
- Our Site **won't be held liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by Our Site is purely for reference. It **doesn't constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, medical, etc.).
- Our Site **won't be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using Our Site's content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations hit a brick wall, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
