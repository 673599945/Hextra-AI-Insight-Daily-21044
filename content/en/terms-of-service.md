# Terms of Service! 🚀

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll lovingly call "the Site" or "us" from here on out)! Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. Cool? Cool. 😉

## 1. Quick Intro to Our Services

The Site offers users paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. This sweet package includes, but isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, premium resources, eBooks, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up, some of the cooler stuff is only accessible to our beloved subscribers! 🌟

## 2. Your Account & Registration

*   **User registration**: To register an account, users gotta provide a valid email address and set up a password.
*   **User responsibility**: Users are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities that happen under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account allowed!** 🚫
*   **Account suspension/termination**: The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're caught breaking these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. All About Paid Subscriptions

*   **Subscription billing**: Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, and the fees will be super clear on the checkout page. No surprises! 💸
*   **Payment processing**: All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Don't worry, the Site never stores your payment info. Your deets are safe! 🔒
*   **Auto-renewal**: Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Set a reminder! 🔔
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're looking for a refund. Each user gets this one-time refund chance, so use it wisely! 😉 Beyond 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, all payments are **non-refundable**, unless required by law. Fair's fair!

## 4. How You Can Use Our Content (and Who Owns It!)

*   **Copyright of original content**: All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without getting our permission first. That's just good manners! 🙏
*   **User access rights**: Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal! 📚
*   **Commercial use/quoting**: If you wanna use our content commercially or quote us extensively, just hit us up to get authorization. We're friendly! 😊

## 5. Play Nice! (User Conduct)

*   **Prohibited content**: **Please don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep it clean! 🚫
*   **Prohibited technical actions**: **Seriously, don't** try to mass download, scrape, or crack our member-exclusive content using technical means. That's just not cool. 🙅‍♀️
*   **Removal/Ban rights**: The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban users who violate these rules**. No ifs, ands, or buts. 🔨

## 6. Service Updates & Downtime

*   **Our right to change/suspend/terminate services**: We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Think of it like an evolving masterpiece! 🎨
*   **Non-liability for interruptions**: The Site **is not liable** for compensation if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Our Disclaimer (Read This!)

*   **Information provided by the Site**: The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). We're good, but we're not *that* good! 😉
*   **Non-responsibility for losses**: The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Use your best judgment, folks!

## 8. The Legal Stuff

*   **Applicable Law**: These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. West Coast vibes! 🌴
*   **Dispute Resolution**: For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should totally try to resolve them through friendly negotiation first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🤞
