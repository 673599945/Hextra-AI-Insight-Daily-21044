# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Your access to or use of **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "this site" or "we" hereinafter) means you're totally cool with and accept these Terms of Service. So, before you dive in, please give 'em a good read. Welcome aboard! 👋

## 1. Service Introduction
**Our services** include paid subscription content and membership options for users, such as blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Just a heads-up: some content is only accessible to subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Account
- Users must provide a valid email address and set a password to register an account.
- You're responsible for your account's security and all its activities. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
- This site totally reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** accounts if anyone breaks these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed monthly/annually, and the fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All payments are handled by awesome third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, this site doesn't store your payment info.
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, unless you totally cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: First-time subscribers can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase if they're not thrilled with the service. Just hit us up via the email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads up, though, each user only gets one shot at this. After 14 days or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by this site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial stuff without our permission. 🙏
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our stuff for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal, folks!
- Wanna use our content commercially or quote us a bunch? Just hit us up for authorization!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Totally prohibited** is uploading, publishing, or spreading any illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or rights-infringing content. Nuh-uh! 🙅‍♀️
- It's **a big no-no** to mass download, scrape, or crack member content using tech tricks.
- This site can totally remove inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Just sayin'.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services anytime, without a heads-up. 😬 Also, **this site won't be on the hook for compensation** if content goes temporarily poof due to things like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service issues.

## 7. Disclaimer
The info we spill on this site is just for reference, okay? It **doesn't count** as professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). And listen up, **this site isn't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just a heads-up! 😉

## 8. Governing Law
So, **these Terms of Service** are totally governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without even thinking about conflict of law principles. Any squabbles about these terms? First, let's try to chat it out nicely. If that doesn't fly, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. ⚖️
